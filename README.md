The base for this code has been adapted from Amanpreet Kaur, Ph.D. (astroaman.kaur@gmail.com). 

With the assistance of my mentor, Dr. Pragati Pradhan, we have updated the code to run on SciServer, iterate over all observations for a target over a range of search offset radii, and print the results to a text file.
