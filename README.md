The base for this code has been adapted from Amanpreet Kaur, Ph.D. (astroaman.kaur@gmail.com). 

With the assistance of my mentor, Dr. Pragati Pradhan, we have updated the code to run on Jupyter Notebook on SciServer, iterate over all observations for a target within a maximum search offset radius, and print the results to a text file. 

When running the code, the results will be saved in a file named pileup_counts_name.txt. This will not overwrite a previous file, so delete or change the output file name before re-running if desired. 

Keep in mind that each observation takes at least a few minutes to run, so iterating over a large set of observations may take quite a while. 

Don't hesitate to contact me at kjcacsciotti@gmail.com with any questions.

If you adapt or use this code in published research, please cite me as Kaitlyn J. Casciotti at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
